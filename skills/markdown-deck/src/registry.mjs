/**
 * The published-deck registry: a committed record of every deck URL a workspace has ever
 * published, so a link someone was given cannot break without the build saying so.
 *
 * A deck's URL is /decks/<deck_id>/, and deck_id is stable only by convention. Editing
 * it, deleting the document or turning deck_publish off would all remove a URL with a
 * green build. The registry remembers, and `reconcile` compares:
 *
 *   a new deck                    is added (update mode) or is a problem (check mode)
 *   a published deck that is gone is a problem, until marked retired or redirected
 *   a redirected deck             gets a redirect page at its old URL, see writeRedirects
 *   a slide id that disappears    is a warning: links to it now open the first slide
 *
 * Update mode is for an author's machine, where the change is then committed. Check mode
 * is for CI, where an unregistered deck means the registry was not committed.
