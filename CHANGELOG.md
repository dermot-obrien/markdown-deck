# Changelog

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions are semantic, with the contract defined as: MAJOR for a changed skill `name`, a removed script, a changed CLI interface or a changed output shape; MINOR for new capabilities, themes or tags; PATCH for wording, fixes and documentation.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-09-29

A patch release, although it adds a capability: before 1.0.0 a requirement such as `^0.6.0` excludes 0.7.0, and nothing here breaks a dependent (DD-11 lists what does).

### Added

- `bin/check.mjs`, the skill's post-install check, as DD-11 of AI-Assisted Work defines it. Run from the workspace root, it checks Node.js 18 or newer, that `npm install` has been run in the skill, and, where `[suite.markdown-deck]` is bound, that the binding parses, the theme exists, the palette names only known tokens and the registry's folder exists. Missing playwright and a missing `mermaid` path are warnings. Exit 0 when all is well, 1 with one line per problem, 2 for a usage or environment error. It needs no `model` skill.
- `bundle.json`, the bundle manifest DD-11 defines, declaring the skill, its version, its purl, its requirements (none) and its check. The marketplace is its `claude-plugin` adapter.
- CI validates `bundle.json` against the bundle schema and the skill with `scripts/validate-bundle.mjs`. The validator and the schema are copies from AI-Assisted Work, in `scripts/` and `scripts/vendor/`, so CI needs no network.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Follows DD-11 of AI-Assisted Work. The skill's identifier is `pkg:generic/dermot-obrien/markdown-deck/markdown-deck`, a requirement on it names that and a range, and releases are tagged `markdown-deck--v<version>`, now without a second `v<version>` tag.
- The marketplace defines one package per skill, `markdown-deck@markdown-deck` as before, instead of a separate `plugin.json` for the whole repository. CI checks each skill's versions agree.
- CONTRIBUTING no longer tells you to install Playwright for the browser tests: `npm install` does, since 0.6.1.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Playwright, which PDF export needs, is now an optional dependency rather than an optional peer dependency, so `npm install` in the skill fetches it. Before, `npm install playwright` reported the package as up to date and installed nothing, because npm counted the peer declaration as satisfied. It installs no browsers: Edge or Chrome is used where installed. If the install is blocked, everything except PDF export still works, and the error says what to run.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-29

Extracted from AI-Assisted Work, where it was `skills/markdown-deck`, into its own repository, https://github.com/dermot-obrien/markdown-deck, so it can be installed and used without that framework. The skill's behaviour is unchanged. NOTICE records the source commit, and the history before this entry is the history of that path in AI-Assisted Work.

### Changed

- Licensed as AI-Assisted Work licenses its skills: content (`SKILL.md`, documentation, themes, examples) under CC BY 4.0 and code under Apache-2.0, declared per file in `REUSE.toml`. `SKILL.md`'s `license` says so, and the skill directory carries `LICENSE`, both licence texts and `NOTICE`, so a copy of it on its own is complete.
- `metadata.requires-skills` is now `metadata.x-skill-requires`, the key the other skills from the same author use. It is still empty.
- `metadata.homepage` names this repository, and `metadata.x-derived-from` names the source commit in AI-Assisted Work.
- `model doctor --skill markdown-deck` is described as optional. It needs the `model` skill, which now has its own repository, https://github.com/dermot-obrien/diagram-model; nothing in a build needs it.

### Added

- The repository is a Claude Code plugin and a one-plugin marketplace, `markdown-deck@markdown-deck`, so other plugins can depend on it by version range.
- `scripts/validate-skills.mjs`, CI running it with the tests, a REUSE compliance check, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `SECURITY.md`.

### Fixed

- `build --refresh` finds the optional `model` skill wherever an agent installed it: beside this skill, on `AGENT_SKILLS_PATH`, or in any project or user skills directory of VS Code with GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex or Gemini CLI. It looked only beside this skill, so a `model` installed by a different tool was reported missing.
- Two freshness tests needed the `model` skill installed beside this one and failed without it. They now use a stand-in, and two tests cover finding it and not finding it.
- The browser tests expected the long table in their fixture to stay on one slide, which it has not done since 0.5.0 split long tables. Its slide now turns splitting off with `table-rows="0"`, so they test shrinking a long table to fit, as they were written to. Ten of them failed before.

- `npm test` failed on Node 18, which `engines` supports, because Node 18 does not expand a glob given to `--test`. `tests/run.mjs` lists the test files instead, on any Node version and shell.

- `npm test` failed on Node 18, which `engines` supports, because Node 18 does not expand a glob given to `--test`. `tests/run.mjs` lists the test files instead, on any Node version and shell.

### Removed

- `scripts/pack-repo.mjs`. It assembled this repository from the framework's copy, and this repository is now the master.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- A `deck:skip` block now keeps every tag inside it off the deck. Before, it only stripped text from a slide's body, so a skip around a whole section or appendix still produced its dividers, slides, images, HTML slides and includes. Headings inside a skip block still end the section before it, as they do in the document.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- `deck:divider`, a section divider slide. Before a heading it takes the heading's text as its title, and the heading's body stays in the document only; with `title="..."` it stands alone anywhere. `subtitle` and `eyebrow` add a line under and above the title; a divider never inherits the deck's eyebrow. It uses the cover's colours unless a theme or palette sets the new `--divider-bg`, `--divider-fg`, `--divider-accent` and `--divider-muted` tokens.
- Long tables split across slides. A table longer than twelve rows continues on the next slide with its header row repeated, rows spread evenly, titled "(1 of 3)" and so on. The first slide keeps the section's id; the rest are numbered on. `table-rows` on a `deck:slide` tag, `deck_table_rows`, the `tableRows` binding and `--table-rows` change the limit, and `0` turns splitting off. `paginateTables` is exported from `src/parse.mjs`.

### Changed

- A deck with a table longer than twelve rows now has more slides than before, and their titles carry "(n of m)". Set `tableRows = 0` in the repository's bindings to keep the previous behaviour, where the table shrank to fit.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Mermaid notes are light boxes with dark text, from the theme's `--accent-wash`, `--rule` and `--slide-fg`. Mermaid sometimes sizes a note narrower than its text, and with the neutral theme's white text on a dark box the overflow vanished, losing a character or two at each edge; dark text past a light box still reads.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Mermaid from a local copy. A deck with a diagram copies `mermaid.min.js` into `assets/` from the nearest installed `mermaid` above the document, or the skill's own, so it draws offline and where the CDN is blocked. The CDN remains the fallback. A `mermaid` binding and `--mermaid` name a file to copy or a URL to load; a named file that is missing is warned about. `findLocalMermaid` and `MERMAID_CDN` are exported.

### Fixed

- Mermaid notes on a slide not yet shown were drawn shorter than their text, so the text ran out of the box. Mermaid sizes boxes from measured text, and text on a hidden slide measures zero; every slide is now laid out invisibly while diagrams are drawn.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- `deck:html`, a whole slide from a self-contained HTML file designed on the 1920x1080 canvas, for a layout Markdown cannot express. It is isolated in an iframe, so its styles and scripts cannot reach the deck, and forwards keys so navigation still works inside it. The files it loads, `src` and `poster` on any tag, `<link>` stylesheets and CSS `url(...)`, are copied into `assets/` and rewritten, so the deck opens from disk. A resource loaded from the network is warned about. `header="true"` and `eyebrow="..."` work as on `deck:image`. The PDF export waits for each frame, its images and fonts to load. `--partials` writes the rewritten file itself.
- Media in Markdown slides. `src` and `poster` on any HTML tag in a slide, such as `<video>`, `<audio>` or `<source>`, are copied into `assets/` like images, and a missing file is warned about as a file. Media over 50 MB is warned about (`mediaWarnBytes` changes the threshold).
- `rewriteResources` and `remoteResources` in `src/parse.mjs`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- `build --refresh`, which re-renders any image whose diagram changed since its render, through the sibling model skill, before building. A failed render fails the build.
- A `pdf` repository default and `deck_pdf` front matter, so `build` exports `deck.pdf` without `--pdf`; `--no-pdf` skips it. `publish` is unaffected. `build()` returns `pdf`, the resolved choice, for callers that export.
- `deck_eyebrow` front matter, the line above every slide title, falling back to `sidebar_label`; `""` turns it off. `eyebrow="..."` on `deck:slide` or `deck:include` overrides it for one slide. An included source is named by its `deck_eyebrow` first.
- Stale-render check. An image with a `<image>.render.json` record whose diagram has changed since the render is warned about, with the command that re-renders it, and fails the build when `CI` is set or `strictRenders` is true. `src/freshness.mjs` reads the record; it has no dependency on the renderer.
- `dependencies` in `manifest.json`: the documents and images each deck was built from, with each image's diagram and whether it is stale. `publish` returns them as `graph`, and `publish --graph` prints them with the sources shared between decks.
- A slide index on the left of `deck.html`: a numbered list of slide titles, click to jump, current slide highlighted and kept in view. It collapses from the « button in its header or with `I`, and reopens from the toolbar; its open state is remembered where the browser allows. On narrow screens it overlays the slide and starts closed.
- Thumbnails in the slide index, PowerPoint style, as an option. Titles only is the default. `--thumbnails` on `build`, or `deck_thumbnails: true` in the document's front matter, makes thumbnails the default for that deck; the Thumbnails and Titles button in the index header, or `T`, switches either way and the viewer's choice is remembered.
- Previous and Next buttons with a slide counter beneath the slide, disabled at either end, and a full-screen presenting button. `F` presents; presenting hides the index and the toolbar.
- The PDF export reports every slide it had to shrink below 60 percent, so a crowded slide is found before it reaches a projector.
- Per-slide review comments, opt in with `--comments` or `deck_comments: true`. One action sends them: Send review (N) appears only once a comment exists and opens a dialog for the reviewer's name, a summary and a single send button labelled by the configured sender, with Copy and Download as fallbacks, then offers to clear what was sent. The sender is looked up by `feedback.method`, email by default, so another backend needs no interface change. The first version put four equal buttons and a name field in the panel, which reviewers found unclear. A Comments panel on the right, `C` to toggle, collects comments against the current slide; the slide index shows a count per slide. Comments stay in the reviewer's browser until they send them: Email review opens their mail client addressed to `--feedback-to` (`deck_feedback_to`), Copy puts the review on the clipboard, and Download saves it as one Markdown file with a machine-readable JSON copy. A review too long for a mail link is copied or downloaded and the email says where to find it, rather than being cut off.
- Stable slide addresses. Each slide has an id from its label, and the address is `#interfaces` rather than `#6`, so a link or a comment still points at the right slide after slides are added or reordered. Numbered addresses still work.
- `--deck-id` (`deck_id`), the stable id that keys a reviewer's stored comments, and `--html-name`, so a deck can be written as `index.html` and served at its folder's URL.
- Repository defaults in `[suite.markdown-deck]` of `.agents/skill-bindings.toml`: `theme`, `comments`, `thumbnails`, `feedbackTo` and `feedbackSubject`, declared in `inputs.toml` so `model doctor --skill markdown-deck` checks them. A deck overrides any of them in front matter (`deck_theme`, `deck_comments`, `deck_thumbnails`, `deck_feedback_to`, `deck_feedback_subject`), and a command-line option overrides both. `bindings: false` ignores the repository.
- `deck:image`, a whole slide from a finished 16:9 image with a title, so slides exported from another deck as PNGs can be pulled in. It stands alone, needs no heading, and takes its place in document order. PNGs are checked from their header: not 16:9, or below 1920x1080, is warned about. `header="true"` draws the deck's header above the image instead.
- `markdown-deck publish <root> --out <dir>`: every document whose front matter says `deck_publish: true` built to `<dir>/<deck_id>/index.html`, with `--list`, `--skip`, `--reserved` and `--pdf`. `src/catalog.cjs` exposes the search as `findPublishedDecks`, and `menuItems` turns it into Docusaurus navbar dropdown items, grouped by `deck_menu`. CommonJS so a Docusaurus config can require it. Moved into the skill from the first repository that used it, so any workspace gets the same contract.
- `deck:include`, a section of another document rendered live as a slide, by `src` and `section`, or by a published `deck` id and `slide` id so moving the source does not break it. The slide is headed "From <source>", and its links and images resolve from the source. A target that cannot be found fails the build, listing what exists. An included section that is only an image is shown full-bleed, filling the canvas with a small source tag, since it is a picture of a slide; `header="true"` keeps the header layout.
- A published-deck registry, bound as `registry` in `[suite.markdown-deck]` or passed as `--registry`. `publish` records every deck URL it publishes, with its slide ids, and fails when a published one disappears until it is marked `retired` or `redirected`; a redirected deck gets a redirect page at its old URL. In CI, or with `--registry-check`, it only checks, so an uncommitted registry fails the deploy. Decks published another way can be passed as `external` and are protected too.
- A test suite under `tests/`, run with `npm test` on Node's built-in runner and no new dependency. Unit tests cover tag parsing, the deck's HTML shape and `build()`. Browser tests check the real layout in Edge, Chrome or Playwright's Chromium: 16:9 at several window sizes with the index open and closed, every slide fitted including hidden ones, margins and full width kept when shrunk, previous and next, the index in both views, collapse, and one 16:9 PDF page per slide. They skip, rather than fail, where no browser can be launched.
- Optional theme tokens for the chrome: `--index-width`, `--index-bg`, `--index-fg`, `--index-rule`, `--index-hover`, `--index-active`, `--toolbar-button`, `--toolbar-rule`, `--toolbar-hover`. Each falls back to an existing token, so current themes need no change.

### Fixed

- Reference links rendered as literal brackets, such as `[PROJ-48][PROJ-48]`. Their definitions usually sit at the foot of the document, outside every slide's section, and each slide is rendered on its own. Every slide now carries the document's link definitions.
- Content ran off the bottom of PDF pages. Fitting measured only the slide on screen, and a hidden slide measures zero high, so every other slide reached the PDF unfitted and was cut off. Every slide is now fitted, hidden ones included, and fitted again under the print layout before export.
- Fitted slides ran into their bottom margin, because the available height was measured including the body's padding.
- A slide shrunk to fit became a narrow column in the middle of a wide slide. Content is now widened before it is shrunk, and the largest scale that fits is found by search, so a shrunk slide still spans the full width.
- Slides were fitted before web fonts and images had loaded, so a late image could push content off the slide. Fitting reruns on load, on each image, on fonts ready and after mermaid renders.
- Images are centred, and a slide holding only a diagram gives it the full body height instead of capping it at 720px.
- The 16:9 canvas is now placed in an explicitly sized frame rather than centred by flexbox, which could crop a slide larger than its container.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-25

First release.

### Added

- `deck:cover`, `deck:slide`, `deck:skip` and `deck:note` tags, expressed as HTML comments so the source document stays readable wherever Markdown renders.
- `markdown-deck build`, producing a self-contained `deck.html` with keyboard navigation, a `manifest.json`, and an `assets/` folder for local images.
- `markdown-deck pdf`, using an already-installed browser in preference to downloading Chromium. On Windows the bundled Edge is used, then Chrome, then Playwright's Chromium.
- Themes as CSS token files. `default` is brand-free and `themes/_base.css` holds the layout, naming no colour. An organisation sets its own colours with a `palette` binding rather than a theme file in the skill.
- `scripts/sync-to-claude.mjs`, the one adapter needed because Claude Code reads `.claude/skills` rather than `.agents/skills`. Has a `--check` mode for a pre-commit hook or CI.
- `scripts/pack-repo.mjs`, which assembles the standalone publishable repository including Claude Code plugin and marketplace manifests.
